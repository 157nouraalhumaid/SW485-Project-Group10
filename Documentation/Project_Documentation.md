1. Problem Statement
Understanding real estate rental prices is crucial for both property owners and renters. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based recommendation system that predicts rental prices based on key property attributes such as land area, location, ratings, and property type. By analyzing historical rental data, the system will provide insights into pricing trends, rating distributions, and market behavior.
This project will leverage supervised learning techniques for price prediction, unsupervised learning for property clustering, and generative AI to generate insights from the dataset.
